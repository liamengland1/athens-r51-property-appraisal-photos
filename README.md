This repository contains photos extracted from appraisal reports commissioned by the Athens, GA Urban Renewal Department in the 1960s as part of the R-51 project, which displaced hundreds of families and destroyed a large portion of the downtown area, including two historically Black neighborhoods. 

The appraisal reports, and other records related to the R-51 project, are held by the University of Georgia Special Collections Libraries: https://sclfind.libs.uga.edu/sclfind/view?docId=ead/ms1633.xml
